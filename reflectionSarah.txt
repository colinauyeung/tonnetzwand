Quick Reflection. Write a quick note that addresses the following three questions:
How much time did you spend on the assignment outside of class?
	Approximately 20 hours were spent on the tonnetzWand.
What did you learn during this project?
	I learned that mapping gestures to musical notes is actually quite difficult. I was lost when it
	came to figuring out what sound I wanted after adjusting the wand. I think that having a better understanding
	of music would have helped.

	On the hardware side, I learned a little bit about how to work with accelerometers and MIDI as I had
	never worked with them before.

What advice would you give to a future student working on this assignment?
	Play around with sensors before you decide exactly what you want to do. Also, start as early as possible!
